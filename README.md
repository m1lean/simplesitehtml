# Simple Site | HTML5

An application that asks the user for their name and age, and then displays a greeting message with age information.


## Features

- This code creates a simple page with a form, an input field for a name, and a "Welcome" button. When the user enters their name and clicks the button, a greeting appears below the form.
- This example includes elements such as forms, text input, buttons, styling using CSS, and a simple JavaScript script to handle the click event of the button and display a welcome message.
## Installation


1. **Download the Code:**
   - Copy the HTML code and the CSS code into two separate files, for example, `index.html` and `styles.css`.

2. **Create Project Folder:**
   - Create a new folder for your project and place both files (`index.html` and `styles.css`) inside it.

3. **Open HTML File:**

5. **Fill in the Form:**
